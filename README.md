# Project Overview

This project analyzes the implementation of Superblocks and Open Streets as potential urban design strategies to improve bike safety in Manhattan. This repository includes Section 2.3, Superblockify Analysis, which I authored as part of a group project. In this section, the Python package *Superblockify* is used for partitioning the Manhattan street network into superblocks. OpenStreetMap network data and demographic data are then analyzed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed superblocks.
